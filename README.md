### Features and Comments

* All the displayed pictures have working links to other sites.
* Navbar has brand title disabled, though it was redundant.
* Navbar shows a hamburguer button when the page is shrunk.
* All button have working links.
* When shrinking Portfolio the image resize is not as elegant as i would have liked, but all images stay inside Card area.
* Was not able to get some padding between pictures in the same row when shrinking the screen.
* Attempted to include some banners inside the images in both the index.html and the portfolio.html but had a hard time setting them up, scrapped the effort.
* Had some text to add a description to the Portfolio.html pictures and made sure that the text didnt overlap or was out of range when screen resize happened.
* It has working media queries in style.css that change the text color and the font size depending on the screen size.
* Contact.html sends an alert that says "Fake Email" and cleans content from text boxes using JS.
* Probably CSS could use more optimization and cleaning up. 

## Conclusion
* Building, stilying and troubleshooting HTML/CSS has its on type of approach and logic, one of the main takeaways I have from this assigment is that everything has to be verified in various screen sizes everytime a component is added to the page. I started resizing screens after I had everything built and consequently had to do a lot of rework. During my research I also read that starting sites from mobile size first and then validating in bigger sizes is a better approach. Will probably take this route in future assigments.
* Used validator right before turning in the assigment, had a lot of errors and took a while to figure out how to correct them without breaking my code. Will engage this early on in next efforts.
