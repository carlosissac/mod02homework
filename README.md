# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
Personal website made in order to exercise key HTML, Git, CSS and Bootstrap concepts. 

## Guidelines
* Create the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.
* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items: `navbar`, a `responsive layout` and `responsive images`.
* Provided snapshots in the material to be used as an example.
* Validate website in various screen sizes.
* Use an HTML validation service.

### Minimum Requirements Checklist.
Listed below are the minimum requirements provided in the original README with added comments.
* Functional, deployed application. --- Done --- Issac
* GitHub repository with README describing the project. --- Created a new README as a report. --- Issac
* Navbar must be consistent on each page. --- Done --- Issac
* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages. --- Done. I disabled  link in the Brand banner message --- Issac
* All links must work. --- Done --- Issac
* Must use semantic html. --- Done, included ALT tags for images --- Issac
* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service). --- Done, no errors are found in the final version. used https://validator.w3.org/nu/ --- Issac
* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.). --- Didn't use my personal picture, it has my LinkedIn bio and links to my personal social media, and stuff that I like. All the pictures have working links. --- Issac
* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system. --- used the following Boostrap link https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/4.4.1/cyborg/bootstrap.min.css, and the following JS links to make the hamburguer link work https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js, https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js, https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js
* BONUS, create a Sticky Footer using Bootstrap and use sub-rows and sub-columns. --- Done. Issac


### Features and Comments
* All the displayed pictures have working links to other sites.
* Navbar has the brand title disabled. I thought having this feature was redundant since we already have an About link. 
* Navbar shows a hamburger button when the page is shrunk.
* All buttons have working links.
* When shrinking Portfolio.Html the image resize is not as elegant as I would have liked, but all images remain inside the Card area.
* Was not able to get some padding between pictures in the same row when shrinking the screen in Portfolio.HTML.
* Attempted to include some banners inside the images for their description in both the index.html and the portfolio.html but had a hard time setting them up. I scraped the effort.
* Had some text to add a description to the Portfolio.html pictures and made sure that the text did not overlap or was out of range when screen resize happened.
* There are working media queries in style.css, these make the text color and the font size change depending on the screen size.
* Contact.html sends an alert that says "Fake Email" and cleans content from text boxes leaving placeholder text in place using JS.
* Probably style.css could have used more optimization and cleaning up.

## Conclusion
* Building, styling and troubleshooting HTML/CSS has its own type of approach and logic, one of the main takeaways I have from this assignment is that everything has to be verified in various screen sizes everytime a component is added to the page. I started resizing screens after I had almost everything finalized and built, consequently had to do a lot of rework. 
* During my research I also read that starting sites from mobile size first and then validating in bigger sizes is a better approach. Will probably take this route in future assignments.
* Used validator right before turning in the assignment, had a lot of errors and it took me a while to figure out how to correct them without breaking my code. Will engage this early on in next efforts.
